ERROR:
I made an error in my demonstration of creating a "Load Case."
I should have specified HALF of the total load in the scale factor
for each included load pattern. For example, instead of having a
scale factor of 1550 corresponding to the 1550 lbs applied on L1,
the scale factor should have been 775. This is because the total
load will be carried by both sides of the bridge. Thus, a single
side of the bridge will only carry half of the total load.

PLEASE:
Try to avoid making this mistake when you set up your models. If
you can, I would suggest coming up with some sort of system that
will help you to remember all of the steps involved in doing the
design and analysis. A cheat sheet might be useful.

ESSENTIAL:
Make sure you have someone else check your work! Many
mistakes from previous years could have easily been avoided if
there had been more peer-checking during design (and indeed, I
can recall a few instances where peer-checks helped to catch
major design flaws.)
